If gluten-free pizza is available, she may still be able to eat it, however, the presence of tomato sauce may be a barrier. Assuming a modified tomato sauce has been substituted with a gluten',\n",

The reasoning is as follows: Pizza crust typically contains a mixture of wheat flour, water, yeast, salt, and sugar, which are the four fundamental ingredients of gluten.

Celiac disease is a chronic digestive disorder caused by an inability to digest carbohydrates. It's not a matter of willpower, but rather a matter of, well, your stomach. And, unfortunately, consuming the kind of carbohydrate-heavy foods that are fundamental to pizza, such as crust, sauce, and cheese, makes it an impossible solution.

This is probably because, when we intervene at the earlier position, we influence all downstream features (and errors) at the colon position as well! So if we miss some upstream features, it's okay. But if we intervene at the colon position, we need to intervene on every relevant feature more or less independently - and even then, there will be some error nodes that push towards \"yuan\". To get to the desired outcome, we need to intervene strongly."
