This is probably because, when we intervene at the earlier position, we influence all downstream features (and errors) at the colon position as well! So if we miss some upstream features, it's okay. But if we intervene at the colon position, we need to intervene on every relevant feature more or less independently - and even then, there will be some error nodes that push towards \"yuan\". To get to the desired outcome, we need to intervene strongly."
